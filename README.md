# Web Development Repository

Welcome to my Web Development Repository! This repository is a testament to my journey in mastering the art of web development. Each project showcases a unique set of skills and experiences, contributing to my growth in this dynamic field. Let's delve into the three key projects within this repository:

## Project 1: Basic Calculator

In the inaugural project, I leveraged HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fundamental yet insightful web application—a basic calculator. The sleek interface, adorned with CSS design, enhances user-friendliness. The JavaScript code facilitates number input and basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), culminating in a result upon pressing '='. This project marked my initiation into the realm of web development, providing a hands-on understanding of the interplay between front-end languages.

## Project 2: Animated Landing Page

The second project marks a pivotal step—the creation of a basic landing page enriched with animations. Crafted using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this landing page goes beyond aesthetics. Animations captivate visitors, offering an engaging experience. Interactive elements, including image hover effects and a visually striking "Contact Us" section, showcase a blend of creativity and functionality. This task, while labeled as "basic," contributed significantly to my evolving expertise in web development.

## Project 3: Personal Portfolio Website

The latest endeavor is my personal portfolio website, a comprehensive showcase of skills and achievements. Powered by CSS, JavaScript, and HTML, the portfolio stands as a testament to my growth. The top menu, featuring a captivating red line effect on hover, adds a dynamic flair. Sections detailing skills, experience, and education boast extraordinary CSS styles, creating a visually appealing narrative. Professional elements, such as LinkedIn and Instagram links, contribute to the overall polish of the portfolio. This project serves as a pivotal representation of my proficiency in web development and the ability to create an impactful online presence.

These projects collectively embody my dedication to mastering web development, providing a tangible progression from fundamental concepts to a sophisticated personal portfolio. Feel free to explore each project and witness the evolution of my skills in this exciting journey of web development.
